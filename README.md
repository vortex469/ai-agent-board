# AI Agent Board

A drag-and-drop Kanban board that delegates coding tasks to AI agents — GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode, Hermes, or OpenClaw. Drop a task into "In Progress," pick an agent, and it will plan, execute, and complete the work, streaming live progress back to the board.

## How It Works

1. **Create a task** in the Backlog column
2. **Drag it to In Progress** — the agent panel opens automatically
3. **Configure the run** — set the repo path, branch name, agent type, and whether to use a git worktree
4. **Click Start Agent** — the selected agent begins working, streaming progress in real-time
5. **Review the results** — commands executed, files modified, output produced
6. **Merge or create a PR** — merge the branch to main locally, or create a PR if the repo has a GitHub remote

### Multi-Agent Architecture

The server uses a **provider pattern** (via [`@codewithdan/agent-sdk-core`](https://github.com/DanWahlin/agent-sdk-core)) to support multiple AI coding agents behind a common interface:

- **`AgentProvider`** — creates sessions, reports availability
- **`AgentSession`** — runs a task, emits events, supports abort
- **`AgentManager`** — orchestrates sessions with timeouts, event caching, and graceful cleanup

Each task can specify which agent to use. Available agents are auto-detected at startup by checking for installed CLIs. Six providers are supported: Copilot, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Hermes, and OpenClaw. Events from all providers are normalized into a common `AgentEvent` format and streamed to the UI via WebSocket.

### Task Groups

For projects needing multiple parallel changes, **Task Groups** let you define a batch of related tasks in a single form:

1. Click **New Group** (or press `G`) to open the group creation dialog
2. Set group-level config: title, repo path, base branch, priority
3. Add child tasks (2–20), each with its own title, description, agent type, and worktree toggle
4. Set **parallelism** with a slider (1 to N) — controls how many agents run concurrently
5. Click **Create & Run** to launch immediately, or **Create Group** to add to backlog

Groups appear as a single card on the board showing aggregate progress. Click to expand the **Group Panel** with per-child status, retry buttons for failures, and drill-through to individual agent panels. Groups auto-advance to "review" when all children complete successfully.

Use **Edit dependencies** on a grouped task to select prerequisite tasks from the current group or other groups in the same project. Links store stable task IDs; cross-group links appear as **Synchronization gates** with Done, Waiting, Failed, Blocked, or Missing status. Cycles and changes to dependencies of running tasks are rejected by the server.

A dependent task waits without reserving execution or creating a worktree until every prerequisite is successfully Done. Coding prerequisites must also have their repository results integrated into the dependent's configured base; existing stale branches or pinned baselines remain blocked for explicit recovery. Read-only prerequisites require successful completion but no Git integration. Auto Run reevaluates waiting groups on server lifecycle changes, and the UI updates over WebSocket. Reopening a prerequisite closes the gate for pending tasks and warns already-running dependents. Deleting a prerequisite retains its missing ID until the dependency is explicitly removed.

### Import multiple roadmap groups

Open **Roadmap Intake**, select the multi-group creation mode, and paste explicit group declarations with numbered tasks:

```text
GROUP: v0.11 Base Building
AGENT: codex
AUTO RUN: false
01. Construction foundation
02. Placement preview
    DEPENDS ON: 01

GROUP: v0.12 Advanced Crafting & Workstations
01. Workstation definitions
02. Workstation integration
    DEPENDS ON: 01, v0.11 Base Building / 02
```

Preview and edit the groups, tasks, settings, and dependency references before creating them. Task numbers identify items within their declared group; use `Group name / number` for a cross-group dependency and commas for multiple dependencies. Versioned names and ampersands are supported. Numbered tasks retain their order within each group.

Optional settings are `AGENT`, `AUTO RUN`, `REPO`, `BASE BRANCH`, `PRIORITY`, and `USE WORKTREE`. Place them after `GROUP:` and before its first task to set group defaults, or after a task to override that task. `BRANCH` sets a task's worktree branch (or the group's base branch when placed before tasks). Boolean settings accept `true` or `false`. Unspecified agent, repository, branch, priority, and worktree settings inherit project defaults; automatic execution is off unless requested. A task with `AUTO RUN: false` pauses its ordered lane until explicitly run.

The server validates the entire import, including unknown or ambiguous references, self-dependencies, and cycles involving group order. It resolves references to database task IDs after creating all groups and tasks. A failed persistence step triggers rollback before any agents start. Imported groups appear immediately, and cross-group links use the existing synchronization gate badges and integration checks. Project Auto Run must also be enabled for automatic execution; prerequisites must finish successfully and their code must be integrated before dependent tasks can start.

Existing loose-card and single-group roadmap formats remain available.

## Features

- Kanban board with Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done columns

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm 10+
- At least one agent CLI authenticated on your machine:
  - **GitHub Copilot**: CLI installed and authenticated
  - **Claude Code**: CLI installed and authenticated
  - **OpenAI Codex**: CLI installed and authenticated
  - **OpenCode**: CLI installed and authenticated
  - **Hermes**: Hermes Agent installed and `hermes acp --check` succeeds
  - **OpenClaw**: OpenClaw CLI installed and Gateway/session access configured

Works on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**.

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanWahlin/ai-agent-board.git
cd ai-agent-board
npm install

# Start both server and client together
npm run dev

# Or run them separately:
# Terminal 1 — API server (port 8080)
npm run dev:server
# Terminal 2 — Vite dev server (port 8081)
npm run dev:client
```

Open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

### Database Options

By default the app uses **SQLite** — zero configuration required.

For **PostgreSQL**, start the database container and set `DATABASE_URL`:

```bash
docker compose up -d

# Set the connection string in packages/server/.env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://agentboard:your_password@localhost:5433/agentboard
```

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build:server
npm run build:client
```

The current single-host production layout uses `kanban-server.service` on `127.0.0.1:8080`, `kanban-client.service` on `127.0.0.1:8081`, PostgreSQL in the `ai-agent-board-db` Docker container, and a dedicated nginx ingress on `127.0.0.1:18085`. Cloudflare Tunnel targets that nginx ingress, and Cloudflare Access provides user authentication. Do not bind these origins to public or Tailscale interfaces.

### Required Gate

Use the deterministic gate before pushing changes. It runs the client build, server build, and required Playwright E2E suite; if E2E cannot run, the command fails.
For documentation-only verification tasks, prefer a minimal, clearly harmless edit and record the focused check that was run.
Auto-run verification follow-ups should keep the change set runtime-neutral when the source item calls for a harmless documentation-only change.
When Auto Run is intentionally off, the first verification item can be satisfied with a documentation-only change that leaves production behavior unchanged.

```bash
npm run gate:required

# Enable the committed pre-push hook for this clone
npm run hooks:install
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `API_KEY` | _(unset)_ | Bearer token for API + WebSocket auth; unset = open access |
| `SERVICE_TOKENS` | _(unset)_ | JSON array of scoped service credentials (`token` or preferred `sha256`) for integrations |
| `VITE_API_KEY` | _(unset)_ | Client-side API key (must match `API_KEY`) |
| `PORT` | `8080` | Server port |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Server/client bind address. Keep loopback when exposing the app through a local reverse proxy or Cloudflare Tunnel. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | _(unset)_ | PostgreSQL connection string; when unset, uses SQLite |
| `DB_PATH` | `./data/agentboard.db` | SQLite database file path |

### Orchestration integrations

`POST /api/orchestrations` is the stable integration facade. It requires an
`Idempotency-Key`, an exact project id/name/alias, and a ready agent. It creates
the task and durably requests execution; replay returns the original task with
`Idempotent-Replay: true`. Project aliases are managed through the project
create/update APIs. Task links use `/projects/:projectId/tasks/:taskId` and open
the task panel directly.

Service credentials are intentionally limited to these scopes:
`projects:read`, `agents:read`, `tasks:create`, `tasks:read`, `tasks:message`, and
`groups:create`. They cannot merge, create PRs, delete resources, or mutate
projects. `API_KEY` remains the legacy full-access credential for the UI.
| `COPILOT_MODEL` | `claude-opus-4-20250514` | Model for Copilot SDK sessions |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | `claude-opus-4-20250514` | Model for Claude Code sessions |
| `CODEX_MODEL` | `gpt-5.2-codex` | Model for OpenAI Codex sessions |
| `LOCAL_OPENAI_BASE_URL` | _(unset)_ | Base URL for an OpenAI-compatible local coding endpoint, e.g. `http://localhost:1234/v1`; requires `/models` and `/chat/completions` |
| `LOCAL_OPENAI_MODEL` | _(unset)_ | Model name sent to the local OpenAI-compatible endpoint |
| `LOCAL_OPENAI_API_KEY` | _(unset)_ | Optional Bearer token for the local endpoint; no auth header is sent when unset |
| `LOCAL_OPENAI_DISPLAY_NAME` | `Local AI` | Display name for the local provider in the agent selector |
| `LOCAL_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS` | `4096` | Optional max output token limit for local coding sessions |
| `HERMES_COMMAND` | `hermes` | Hermes CLI command or absolute path used to start the ACP server |
| `HERMES_MODEL` | `configured default` | Display/configured model label for Hermes sessions; Hermes ACP uses its own active config |
| `HERMES_ACCEPT_HOOKS` | _(unset)_ | Set to `true` to auto-approve Hermes startup hook prompts in headless ACP sessions |
| `OPENCLAW_COMMAND` | `openclaw` | OpenClaw CLI command or absolute path used to start the ACP bridge |
| `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` | _(SDK default)_ | Optional OpenClaw Gateway WebSocket URL forwarded to `openclaw acp` |

| `AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS` | `3600000` | Default max agent execution time (60 minutes). Tasks can override this from 1–240 minutes. |
| `AGENTBOARD_WORKTREE_DEPENDENCY_CONCURRENCY` | `2` | Maximum concurrent `npm ci` installs for Board-managed task worktrees. |
| `AGENTBOARD_WORKTREE_MIN_FREE_SPACE_BYTES` | `8589934592` | Minimum free space required on the worktree filesystem before provisioning dependencies (8 GiB). |
| `API_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Vite proxy target |
| `VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `localhost,127.0.0.1` | Vite HTTP and proxy-upgrade Host allowlist. Loaded from `.env` or the process environment. Add trusted reverse-proxy hostnames; never use a wildcard. |
| `PROJECTS_DIR` | `~/projects` | Host projects path |

### Execution timeouts and event retention

Agent Board defaults each run to 60 minutes. Set a task's **Time limit** to override that run from 1–240 minutes; integrations can send `timeoutMinutes` (or `timeout_minutes` through the Hermes plugin). Timed-out orchestrations should be retried on the same card through `POST /api/orchestrations/:id/retry`, optionally with a larger limit, so status and history remain tracked.

A longer timeout does not pre-fill or resend an hour of context by itself. The selected provider controls its own conversation/context window, while Agent Board forwards the initial task and then consumes provider events. Longer runs can still make more model calls and produce more tool output. The server caps its in-memory event cache at 2,000 events per task and coalesces rapid output for WebSocket delivery, but persists raw events in the database until a task is rerun or deleted. Operators should therefore monitor the `events` table and archive/delete obsolete high-volume tasks according to their retention policy.

## Tests

```bash
# Required deterministic gate: client build, server build, E2E
npm run gate:required

# Required E2E only; starts isolated test app processes on ports 3002/4176
npm run test:e2e:required

# Run directly from the E2E workspace
cd packages/e2e && npx playwright test --reporter=list
```

The local pre-push hook in `.githooks/pre-push` runs `npm run gate:required`. Run `npm run hooks:install` once per clone to enable it with `core.hooksPath .githooks`.

## Development

`npm run dev` starts the client and server together. Use `npm run dev:client` and `npm run dev:server` to run them separately. Run `npm run gate:required` before pushing.

```bash
npm run dev              # client + server
npm run dev:server       # API only (port 8080)
npm run dev:client       # Vite only (port 8081)
npm run gate:required    # required before push
```
